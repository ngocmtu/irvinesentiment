$AAPL this stock is so easily spooked that lets you know that no one is really bullish on it or it would not sell off on every little thing
$AAPL that is a wrap it will trade around here and then we have a new low tomorrow
$AAPL tomorrow will be 5 down days of 6. This stock was already weak before the downgrade
$AAPL clearly learned nothing in 2013.  Shareholders again get burned by complete silence. Vote with Icahn board does not care
$AAPL when both upgrades and downgrades have the same result red you have broken stock
$AAPL this is with good news.  Wait till bad news starts rolling in.
$AAPL the more it falls the less likely people stay around if it even gets a pop just another reason to short this
$AAPL still has long way to climb just to get back to china deal level let alone higher.  Think bulls are getting ahead of themselves
$AAPL Falling after hours
$AAPL continues to shrug off any positive news that makes it a sell
$AAPL so much for pre market not mattering sell this stock is done
"$AAPL Walter Isaacson, author of the biography Steve Jobs, said in a CNBC TV interview that Apple is now less innovative than Google"
$AAPL days when Timmy makes an appearance are always bad for apple lock him in a tower.  Put him in Iron Mask.
$AAPL Timmy saying good things are coming does more damage then good.  Reminds people how little you have done.
$AAPL short lived victory come monday the truth will come out
$AAPL till next week.. monday night will tell us everything
$AAPL Need to write big thank you note to TC.
$AAPL bulls Needs to taze TC every time he speaks that would save you money
$AAPL even I thought it would have bounced a little at some point today
$AAPL looks like the bulls are craking all over the place 15% in a month is not enough beating for them.
$AAPL How Apple CEO Tim Cook Infuriates Investors http://stks.co/rvvO
$AAPL day 4 of nothing but red
$AAPL I give bulls credit they come up with all sorts of ideas to convince themselves this stock is going higher
$AAPL still very bullish nothing changed
$AMZN Even with ebook accounting change it&#39;s a revenue miss
$AAPL nice .. bot puts worth a bulk load
$TWTR .. Today&#39;s price action was short covering.. Can&#39;t explain how company makes money. $FB is better off with more users and ad plans..
$TGT My guess is it will go down when the banks start sending them the bill for all the new debit and credit cards :)
"$TGT I started a new way of seeing shorts on the chart.  Very interesting. Since TGT announced breach, Bears have been quiet.  1/4"
$TGT Our they on time this time?  Take a look at the chart  4/4 http://stks.co/i0914
$TGT geesh.  1 minute after closing and i receive my &quot;Dear Target Guest&quot; you are a victim letter.  Free credit monitoring with Experian.
$IBM Buyers beware. Be patient till this one settles down in low $170&#39;s. There is nothing to be bullish about in the conference call.

$NUAN sold all tidy profit for lower re-entry on $QQQ $SPY pullback
$BBRY not a buy . . ..instead look at $JCP $AAPL $UVXY $TVIX $VXX at lows
$BBRY they&#39;ll fade her bigger now that they see blood in the water with volatility kicking in $UVXY $VXX $TVIX
$BBRY dollar flow out now into $JCP $AAPL and volatilities
$BBRY short for 9s today on $QQQ $SPY pullback

$AAPL I think I&#39;d rather sleep on a Cactus than own this POS. Can&#39;t wait to dump this
$AAPL look at the 10 year chart. We will see lower prices.
$AAPL what a utter POS.
$AAPL I would not be surprise to see $520 by the 17th. And then $600 by Feb 3rd
$AAPL started my BEAR rating at $535 on Monday
$AAPL horrible POS. we need sub 70% sentiment to turn this around
$AAPL zero growth companies deserve a PE of 9. So target price is $360 with flat earnings.
@NextTrade1122 No. $SPY up less than 3x (6xx to 18xx since &#39;09) $AMZN up 8x. Everyone is just chasing it.

@LMuldoon Could lose more. If $amzn had same multiple as $wmt would be around $100/share
@tradewithjoe $amzn has been missing for years now but analysts keep lowering estimates so it doesn&#39;t look as bad.
"Correct me if I&#39;m wrong but if, companies like $bby finally started price matching and fighting $amzn on price, how can that a positive?"
&quot;Retail missed this season because of Amazon&quot; pundits are going to have some explaining to do if $AMZN misses. $SPY $QQQ
$AMzn up $18? Did they already report the top line miss and lower guidance?
I am pretty sure $AMZN and Best Buy missed Wall Street estimates by the same percentage. (Just under 2%) $spy $ua $goog $ bby

@teamusainc @tyla858 Myspace - never forget. Ha fuck $FB and its&#39; stupid market cap. $TWTR as a trading vehicle is far superior.
@MidnightDreary No I&#39;m saying $FB sucks compared to $TWTR . Ever hear of cell phones? Those work just fine and they save your time from $FB.
"@Babyturtle $FB is old hat, it&#39;s a fad and it gets boring after a few years so traffic will dry up. $FB with a $300B market cap? Get real."
@Girba No I&#39;m just wise enough to recognize $FB at this price is only good for one thing - that&#39;s decreasing the supply of my $USD.
@ZuckIt I can&#39;t like this twit enough. Even if $FB inherited $TWTR for free it wouldn&#39;t be worth $135B.
"@bakbo $EURUSD operation on that is funky intra-day, if there&#39;s too much buying it&#39;ll go down, too much selling it will go up. It&#39;s high."
"@Kavaron forget shorting the $USD it&#39;s going to compress the other currencies, best pair is $EURAUD short long-term. 4% interest is nice."
@Ty_Dvorak nice thing about $EURUSD short is that significant gains are practically guaranteed mod-term.
"@DavesNotHere @ZuckIt That&#39;s the thing, I don&#39;t care. I&#39;m here to help. Here&#39;s a fun fact: $FB sucks and it&#39;s wildly overvalued."
"@JanineK @duke2duke $FB has approached maximum capacity, earnings are lacking. An appropriate valuation would be $15 on 50x earnings."
"@protseng Sure, go ahead and buy that overvalued POS $FB when it&#39;s 12% up like a sucker. As a blue chip it&#39;s life span will prove short."
@ScumbagMM @StockSandwich I wouldn&#39;t fret if I held $20B in shorts on $FB. I could just hold all decade and cover at $10. Decent return.
@ScumbagMM @StockSandwich I wouldn&#39;t fret if I held $20B in shorts on $FB. I could just hold all decade and cover at $10. Decent return.
"@MD427 @ScumbagMM The thing is I don&#39;t think it sees $70 and I don&#39;t care if it does, there&#39;s more money on the short side up here. $FB"
"@bt24_7 When the market sells $FB will be among the most vulnerable, S&amp;P made a mistake putting $FB in their lineup."
@trj206 Why do you think that I care what happens to the stock? $FB is a naughty trading vehicle and a company without longevity.
"@Hugopinto @OptionsWizard @haly Expanding in foreign markets will buy $FB time, I&#39;ll admit that. But only an extra decade tops."
@MidnightDreary @Hugopinto @haly @OptionsWizard many bands still prefer myspace over $FB. Adult bands.
@prognolic EPS for $FB is weak. But what&#39;s weaker is their flimsy trendy website that won&#39;t stand the test of time. It gets boring.
"@Data_Miner Correction: they want to sell, not exit. Big positions can&#39;t exit $FB without killing the price. Hold agreements, etc."
"That morbidly obese beast $FB trading sideways, shorts should take advantage if it corners, which I doubt. Selling getting overwhelming yet?"
@Debo08 If the big boys want to hold up $FB they&#39;ll have to keep buying tons.. Eventually over saturation will get overwhelming.

$DE now starting to retrench. Yet some way to go. No reason to hurry. No entry without proper base.
SELL $CSCO @21.90 for +0.87% (if standard tailing limit used: already sold Friday). No short term chance to close gap. Sentiment too high.
"$SPY&#39;s  movement yesterday of great importance. Even a sign of rising risks, when massive rebound today. (Different to Nov - no news!)"
"$NFLX: although intraday view not meaningful,now obvious, that awaited 320 target becomes reality. First base building maybe at Nov levels"
"$NFLX:reached 320 traget already yesterday. Interpretation now difficult,although downward pressure should continue until it moves with $SPY"

"$SPY, $EM - p. 3: movements in Argentina, Venezuela, South Africa, Turkey will foreshadow and determine the early stages of the crisis."

"$SPY, $EM - p. 9: containment even at this stage is possible. China and EMs can manage this, if they get everything right.(Is that possible?"
"$SPY, $EM - p.10: The individual actors: Leveraged entities sell where they can sell, not where they want to sell. (Which means in the US.)"
"$SPY, $EM - p.11: All leveraged actors stampede to pay back their carry trade credits, mainly in $FXY and inflict themselves further losses"
"$SPY, $EM - concl.: At some point the bubbles inflated by easy money will pop. Esp. because they are everywhere and something will go wrong."
This crisis is a combination of current account problems ($EEM) and a bubble in the shadow banking system ($FXI) with US knock on effects.
In a second stage $EEM companies will suffer rising defaults and shrinking property and (again) stock market values and more capital flight
"The social and political unrest in Thailand, Egypt et al are here to stay and this will alter the risk perception of investors (for $EEM) ."
"$FXI: A few hundred rich investors in a shadow banking product were bailed out. So moral hazard here, less fear and bubbles still inflate."
"$EEM: Turkey and Fed should guarantee another leg up, but generally the chart here is less convincing than the $FXI, but both are fragile."
"$SPY et al: The Fed didn’t even mention the $EEM crisis and rightly so. Easy money policy caused it, but cannot cure it!"
"$SPY et al: The Fed didn’t even mention the $EEM crisis and rightly so. Easy money policy caused it, but cannot cure it!"
$EEM central banks lulled by 14 years of easy money and using the same medicine over and over again
Now the $EEM countries are following the rule book of the last crysis. This time it’s different. You can’t keep all those bubbles inflated.

@supermanjoe IMO $FB will drop back to $30-50 long-term. Future YEARS expecting LIBERAL growth have already been factored into the price.
@supermanjoe $150B market cap on a company that hasn&#39;t even proven itself profitable for a decade is not cheap. $FB is high risk ATM.
@MarcusWyatt $EURAUD my choice pair this year. Long-term I think it will perform best. $AUD moving against the $USD that&#39;s a good sign.
$FB walking up because some stubborn people are sucking up the supply. I&#39;m arbitrarily bearish at these prices. Be shrewd buyers.

Veryyyy sticky icky! whooooo wweeeee
@Rebuy27 if ur going to try be a long cowboy yea.
@SaltydogTrader Pretty much. Hard to see this one breaking out again until April -- and then you have to face all the employees selling!
"@upsidetrader @Loyola80 @hertcapital game, set, match. We break the s&amp;p lows soon. Art Cashin said we &quot;almost went over the cliff&quot; stick sav"
@lucidi I&#39;m not liking this...
@Profit_Prophet looks like it is about to drop hard
@TanMan295 forget trading this.  Been calling out every pullback since it started.  I buy low sell high
@SunMoonMars bought at $8 and $4.50; sold at $11.50 two weeks ago.
@LightningBear i sold at $11.33
@Stock1000 @swifttrader72  good luck my friends.. will check twit on weekends    trade is just part of lifeâ€¦ and it should easy and fun  :P
@Samiam213 your post pretty much shows why add pricing power of @Twtr is lagging industry
"@jarsch I like netflix service, but valuation is difficult. Cost of doing business-content is expensive.  Twtr model/value is mind boggling"
"@truongnht still short,,,, had a chance to cover sht at 71.74..."
"@agwarner Of course it does. Supporters don&#39;t care about, P&amp;L&#39;s, margins and sponsorship agreements. Results are the only thing that matters"
"@SlavaK u are overlooking the obvious, 50% down since, i didn&#39;t steer anybody here wrong, nothing more to read into it than that"
"above 9.5 and i will retract the short call, whats the deal w/ identifying resistance?"
"@ToddSullivan @herbgreenberg YES.  Todd the voice of reason.  Exactly, who is buying with this REG risk."
@DrizzyStocks Remember when you were personally attacking me bag holder? lmao I was trying to warn the board but I don&#39;t even feel bad for U
@Kristin @TBI just hapd to see aegr bo on 60min
"Let&#39;s face it, disclosure timing was influenced by holiday sales considerations"
@gabbs glass is aimed at consumers.  you might not be a farmer... but you are a consumer right?
There is a chance doing a right shoulder later and it may be the last chance to quit. The market is bearish unless strong up candle
@TheBauus @AgentZero Constant DEBT creation and money printing will render those &quot;profits&quot; of the Goldilocks world the 1% live in worthless!
@TrendAdvisory @EvlMonkey I love it when I see things get violated... :)
@1991previa it needs to test 55.50 again.  This SHOULD see 54s temporarily tomorrow
"@Plauze2001 a month from now it could be ANYWHERE.  trying to predict directionality without seeing earnings is very hard. ST=down, LT = ???"
@OptionsNoobi @igreed understatement although I&#39;m looking for a breskdown. Soon.
@BeckyHiu It&#39;ll head down..
"@QuickCASH You think down that low? I bought puts last week, so that&#39;d be nice"
@Capitalistrain See ya at 5 on Bby
@imsuzeorman Yep. Dont be greedy.
@AKEB I have no idea! This is why I closed my calls. Today there is still excitement. Tomorrow should be a major pullback. I&#39;m in puts
@oneambessa I actually took the gamble and held the position through earnings. I took profit at the open today and then went short.
@CleverTrade Today?
@chrisokaly bad move...dilution tends 2 cause end of day sell off.
@Kitsilano I&#39;m afraid you&#39;re ignoring the effects of a 125M share dilution at $10. Could see resistance there for months on end ;)
@pt7314 Lol!
@gwynn19 That is def yikes.
@momoneynow haha!
@OneMorePoint @DjB916 you need to assume most if not all news is priced in because you are a nobody and know nothing more than the mm&#39;s
@Stef540 So much for that theory lol. Still bearish tho
@fourkey2001 next week is going to be more crazier .. Fed might cut QE again.. I hope... good for my pair
"@eatlovetrade Agreed. Stock sucks right now. My cost basis is $292, so it will surely go lower than that."
@ms101 $330 for gap fill first
@CVecchioFX On the daily the long term trend is still down though ... I&#39;m short on this. I don&#39;t see anything confirming firm upwards.
@Howyodoing Below $6!!! Please refer to to week following Dec. 11
Can&#39;t take it anymore. Out @5.87
@chronikl shoooort
"@sm44 It is more than buyback, it has been in 400s for the last year but the buyback never got kicked in much"
@blangtang Hope they are wrong this time.
@inventurecapital bogus numbers.
"@DaddyBiscuits ...but they are displaying ibeacon at the show, maybe they have nothing up their sleeve"
"@BullsOnParade the more i check this board, the more it looks like sheep to slaughter, people forget the same bull sentiment before 1/13 er"
"@contrarianspeculator like gundlach but somewhat of one hit wonder with aapl 700-400, look at poor calls on goog and cmg"
"It&#39;s a done deal @kleo ... May see lower than $450 by end of February. It&#39;s really not appetizing at these levels. They say buy, I say why?"
@tradevix in a winter like ours I doubt they sold enough to empress the street.... I think Blackrock bought an expensive Croc Skin Bag
@AG_Financial u did good
@lionking i disagree
@CoolHobieCat Clear as dynamite this stock isnt worth the time
@Golferbob Not looking good.  Don&#39;t think it will hold at 26.
@TraderVancouver You might want to consider getting out of this stock or going short as things look bleak for oil.
"@Stef540 I&#39;m not buying this. I was long puts but this was way more than I expected. Busted pattern = more weakness... IMO, of course."
@contrarianspeculator because the market will too
@Mr_Mayers It will. The company is nice but only at a fair price of 200. People will realize this bubble tomorrow.
@showmedahammer When I come to Cinci need to go for a drive and then lunch with Elon. :-)
@eddyhooks Closing below yesterday&#39;s lows would be terribly bearish - I guess we&#39;ll find out here soon.  Behind Door #3....
@TraderFlorida Long time no see.  Glad to see you and I are on the same side this time. Where is your exit?  54 or 52?
"Joke&#39;s on me, guys. Joke&#39;s on me."
sure 4.50 works for me  http://stks.co/c04tp
"@KimbleCharting After AAPL it&#39;s gonna be like trying to swim with a piano tied to it&#39;s ass, possible but hard."
"@bikerburt We definitely agree on that. To justify current valuations, FB will have to grow by X number of times rather than in percentages."
$SGDJPY Wedge breakout. Bear power expected. #forex #sgdjpy http://stks.co/h0CUq
@EG_0 buy the puts. double down!
@osubuck30 walk it down to $320
@Longtrader @OneMorePoint all those extra shares are tough to fight through when theres no volume
@sonic66 is that english?
@sonic66 ok... http://stks.co/qrvO
"@straightsix falls right in line with all the pumping here.  &quot;hey we own a bunch of shares, let&#39;s pump it&quot;"
@joeG69 Cos I&#39;m bull long term.
@heresjohnny130 me
@Raskol25 Keep replying and liking my old posts btw. I make money when you try to fade me. Do what you do one week and lose it all the next
@marginmoney And when will it end. Give us targets.
@Raskol25 @Lindy235 you love choo choo trains don&#39;t ya boy? Choo choo on through! Hahaha!
@Raskol25 Name one successful day trader. Warren buffet? The richest investor definitely sits in his undies like you drawing retardangles.
@treeFarmer Good call lol
@TrendAdvisory Lol there&#39;s no such thing as &quot;precisely&quot;. Longer term target is 45$.
@Raskol25 @packetbrain @stocktwits he is right. He has his freedom of speech and I have a privilege to make $$$. We all got rights boys.
@Raskol25 @packetbrain @stocktwits he is right. He has his freedom of speech and I have a privilege to make $$$. We all got rights boys.
@Colorado_Crude It&#39;s already taken off.
@000000 Might see a big bounce here
@DividendEquity I agree. Some of these high-fliers will be hit hard.
Shorting this monday if no news come out. Otherwise I am still short my shares @ 2.33. Small short position.
@SullyinFL @edon Risk I can take from all my profits and knowing how she works. Hope for weekend news but if not I will short. Small profit.
@Leeroy_Trader @SaltydogTrader it&#39;s ugly. brutal for all the employees with shares locked up until May. #paperrich
@SMU_Trader @pftrades @SaltydogTrader May 5th. So you figure people start pricing in that extra liquidity in April.
@Loyola80 @remark @mccartjt @BonHott @mikete90 @InsiderBuySuperstocks My bad it was II not AAII with 57.6% bulls 15.1% bears
@ricky6116 anytime
@WeeGoody @StandpointCapitalLLC They deff under performed in 2014
@Zubair84 big priceline DIP minutes away
"@Hedgistan766 Big boys will, trust me, they will :)"
@trismigistus Yes. But it still has me over it.
@donaldduck666 No. I married my 2nd cousin.
@DocStoc By Friday.
@rentacop89 In too deep to sell now.
@TheEngine3r I wish I had that power. JCP is doomed with or without me.
@mamacitalinda Que te pasa chica? Why so bearish on JCP?
@leowhy You mean the end if JCP.
@Volraid3r Cojones? I&#39;ve got jalapeños.
@deut818 Agreed - no real support yet until 11.50 on the chart.  Will fall a few at 14.30 or 15 IF it can get there. Entry better later.
@keiser9000 Their ER is not until MARCH 31. They have no PR department - notorious for lack of PR for weeks at a time.  You stall - you fall
@betachaser WF downgrade? Not to sure - lets see. But yes - will fill gap quickly.
@SteelWheels Big Gains but ER not until MARCH 31  Company Reputation is lack of PR or defense to attacks. Not sustainable. Ripe for shorting
$APPL needs to get over 555.00 in a hurry or just tail slowly into 550.00 and then just down to support.
@Gukaso hey i sold at the high - tell me this stock doesnt make a long sea sick. . .but just saying that is where it was before bad PR.
