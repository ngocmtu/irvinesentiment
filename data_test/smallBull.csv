Added Delta Airlines and Community Health Systems to the PA portfolio. Intend to share thoughts on these in the coming days. $DAL $CYH
I recently added Delta Airlines to my PA portfolio. Here is my investment thesis: http://stks.co/f0Ado $DAL
"&quot;@Predator: observation;  1 yr cap gain for $AAPL 0.0%, $BBRY -35%,  $ATHX  +126%,  $CUR +129%,  $ONVO 146%. guess where the smart $ went.&quot;"
"$DDD typical entire sector painted w/ one brush in a panic, then discernment...people go mad in crowds and come to their senses one by one"
$ONVO love the stabilizing here in mid-11&#39;s...great basing action for next run
$ONVO meeting with analysts from Jeffries today. This unwarranted drop based on sham &quot;research&quot; may quickly reverse
"@valuewalk $DDD who are you? not an individual?  Relentless negative tweets on $ONVO too, do you have something to do with Citron? Short?"
