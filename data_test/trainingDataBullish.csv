$AMRN eod weekend buying runup for pre market PR tuesday
"$KNDI models ranked as the top two on the list with over 2,500 EVs produced, more than 1/3 of the total EV production in China in Dec"
@ffexts $KNDI already has Joint Venture w/ Leading Domestic Battery Maker &amp; Power Co. to Create China&#39;s 1st Battery Rental &amp; Replacement Co.
"purchasers of $KNDI EVs will have easy access to multiple, easily reached changing stations throughout the city,"

"$AMRN VascEPA helping with epilepsy now too? Not surprised, its not a hard drug miracle maker but it has multiple benefits naturally (typo)"
$KOOL wow closed above 2.25
@CNBC__LIVE FDA scandal and what they&#39;ve done to $AMRN and the expense of the American publics health is going to be bigger then the IRS
"$KNDI Workin&#39; so hard like a soldier

$VRNG Are we there yet? Any minute now? #GroundhogDay
I&#39;m in $ARIA but feel there is more reward in riding $AMRN up as the next to go from 2 to 7&#39;s then $ARIA already in 7&#39;s
I&#39;m in $ARIA but feel there is more reward in riding $AMRN up as the next to go from 2 to 7&#39;s then $ARIA already in 7&#39;s
$VRNG  The infringement case covers most of the tech giants and the potential payouts would be enormous #gameovershorts
You really think $PFE is going to let $AZN win the combo statin war? PFE needs a combo. $AMRN best in class only choice #anygivenweekend
"long $AMRN from 2 to 9, short $ARIA from 9 back down to 2 pair trade of the decade over this weekend"
now either $PFE or $GSK will get $AMRN  cheaper. so ony hope for $ARIA PFE bid is if $GSK wins $AMRN
In other words this china macro news which doesn&#39;t actually even affect $KNDI created a rare gift pullback add op Fri.. back to 15&#39;s this wk

"$KOOL with all good news in the cc and some exciting ground breaking results revealed, this should at least go back to todays hod 2.80"
$KOOL  &quot;This is a significant breakthrough for medicine as all the patients enrolled were scheduled for amputation&quot;
$KOOL The disclosed a large amount of institutional investors and the FDA is letting them skip phase 2 #fasttrack
@investbyads a/h drop is so overdone on a beat especially that it may be back to 550 by 930am opening bell after pre market bear trap $AAPL
$KOOL cc must not have been good right cus stock is down and thats truth right? no need to read transcript and do DD that supports 4&#39;s
"$KOOL first to save limbs of amputees period but waith theres more, AND have them walking again saved limb. 60 min bedside therapy. great cc"
$GOOG appeal will be deined $VRNG justice will be served for once
$VRNG ZTE is even bigger possibly 5x the size. $40-50 possible with the ZTE victory&quot; but mitk says there is nothing after this and no1 cares

$VRNG hawkeyeguy you just got hustled
$VRNG his grandparents whose basement he lives in made him stop trading even paper trading so now he just annoys everyone. smh
$VRNG The 6.5% royalty ruling is more than double the price of the entire Company. Clearly there is huge upside in this stock.
"$VRNG not much reason left for goog to have its back channel untraceable entities short this. all thy&#39;eve done is keep it pined, not lower"
$VRNG flat but thst more nervous for shorts making nothing and can be blown out the water at any time. longs can relax at undervalued pps
$VRNG and once it does go higher and then you believe it its not going to give you another chance at these prices thats why DD. the math
$VRNG once you see clear and know its wroth more then this on facts you can buy hold and relax whiel shorts sweat bullets for pennies

$XON still maintaining the $35 Q1 price target.
@BIGPHILLY but to be clear if i had more free cash. I would buy into $ZIOP.
$XON glad to see this name start to fill in to reflect its fundamentals.
My Q4 PT is $35. Earnings are on i believe Feb. 6th. Year end 2014 PT $70+ $XON has a ton of partnerships.
$XON Partnership news: http://stks.co/g0AEf
My 2014 PT on $AAPL is $825. Fundamentals and future growth is being ignored.
Nothing wrong with $DDD. Buy the dip on $DDD which resulted from $XONE downgrade and $SSYS weakness. $DDD is the 3D printing leader.
The sell off in $NFLX seems like a gift 1 week ahead of earnings.
@TradeNice i have a conservative growth price target of $65-70 by Q4. This is very much a growth story with $XON as a industry leader.
Buy $HLF on $NUS weakness. The SEC and Auditors already stated their opinion on $HLF. Its a free 10%% from here.
I don&#39;t think it is wise to exit any existing positions in $EXPE based on news from 1 blog. Especially two weeks before earnings.

$GALE That&#39;s what Power Hour was designed to do. Let&#39;s see it happen. :-)
@GibbGA @ICE820 $ELTP may make a move up into the close. Just a guess.  I like today. Some consolidation after yesterday.

@CandyCoated Good! It&#39;s about darn time. $VRNG
$RNN Can $ELTP break to the upside into the close? Looking close here. Go $RNN!!!!
$INO Not sure why a critic would own a stock for their children if they wanted it to go down.
$GALE Hourly chart trying. Let&#39;s go Galena!
$GALE Have to break out of today&#39;s range to keep going higher IMO. 6.11 needs to step aside and we&#39;ll see then.
$GALE Iffy stuff. Oh surprise!
"$GALE Also, Options are a great idea for hedging here as well."
$GALE Ah come on guy behind the curtain. Throw us the 6.13. Really. what&#39;s it gonna hurt?

$GALE Stair stepping again would be nice.
@Daniel924 I agree. Could very well close at the high. GL Daniel! $GALE
$RNN While not that exciting. Nothing wrong with gelling here around $1. A penny or two lower is bought right back up. We&#39;ll break above
$RNN soon enough IMO.
$GALE Looks upish IMO.
$INO Very much time for a green candle on the close here. Let&#39;s do this!

$KNDI Bought some Jan calls @15. Should be 16 at least in a week.
"$KNDI Here&#39;s what IBD says about its partnership w Greeley (China&#39;s GM, tried to buy Volvo) to produce 100,000 EVs. http://stks.co/qqFm"
$KNDI I bought June options to ride out the early bouncing.
$KNDI This stocks biggest problem is it&#39;s too low. Trust issues. Once it hits mid 20s it&#39;s a fast ride to 50.
"$KNDI The longer this bakes here, the more solid the comeback."
"$KNDI As much as I revere $tsla, esp tech, revenue wise, it pales compared to $kndi mkt potential short term."
$KNDI Glad I didn&#39;t listen to chartist re:gap after $tsla first blast off. I&#39;d have shorted myself broke.
$KNDI Sometimes a good cigar is a good cigar. Wouldn&#39;t get too cute trying to short a power play.
$KNDI No news rallies most stable. Mkt momentum.
$KNDI Bought jan @15. Needs 15.25 break even. Not bad odds.
$KNDI Population. Pollution. Solution. Shorting because ...?
$KNDI Population. Pollution. Solution. Shorting because ...?

"&quot;$KNDI China Dec. EV Prod numbers out. KNDI-Geely captures 42% of all EVs with 2,618 for Dec. Alone. http://stks.co/e06T6&quot;&quot;"
$KNDI But or sell on data. Not agenda. Shots list no reason.
$KNDI Early adopters r rewarded not just for vision but tenacity.
$KNDI Shorting SHOULD be illegal. Don&#39;t like. Don&#39;t buy. Casino mentality.
$KNDI Not enough pollution? Mkt to small? No Gov support? Partner too big? Overvalued? Silly.
$KNDI $tsla flying. $Kndi buying.
$KNDI Anyone test a $tsla correlation
$KNDI Bid/ask 13.10/13.13. Any guess on open?
$TSLA Feel badly for shorts? The meanest bears in the biz. Gleefully tried to kill a Great American company. Reap what you sow.
&quot;@rayinla: $TSLA to $KNDI is sedan vs. golf cart...&quot;  &quot;Golf carts&quot; are appropriate w Chinese speed limit @ 30 and EV needed there NOW.
$KNDI Jan Puts freaking out Short SQUEEZE!
$KNDI Anyone hear rumbling?
$KNDI Could be a two buck day. Been ready for awhile.
"&quot;@RookieTradr: $TSLA wow, just wow!&quot; Perfectly said."
$TSLA Where&#39;s my homies from the teens. Used to be pretty lonely around here. Bears were abusive.
$TSLA Pop goes $kndi. $2 day?
$TSLA Pop goes $kndi. $2 day?
&quot;@stoxrox: $TSLA is not comparable to $KNDI so stop comparing KNDI&quot; U obviously haven&#39;t a clue. Relax.
&quot;@stoxrox: $TSLA is Sports Cars $KNDI is golf carts&quot; Just what u need in China.
$KNDI Short squeeze building.
$TSLA $kndi pop w vol.
$TSLA $kndi flying.
$KNDI We know a rally is imminent. Today is a nice day.
$KNDI Tighter $tsla correlation every day. Both filling gap now.
"&quot;@BullzNBearz:: $KNDI http://stks.co/a06mQ production up 382% in December, explosive growth&quot; I thought $TSLA was growing wow KNDI&quot;"
"$KNDI Pollution in China Public Health crisis. Officially, hundreds of thous. of deaths. EV now Gov mandate. No downside fundamentals. Cheap"

$BAC Who invests in a company that ups $TSLA price target from $50 to $60 ish today. The WORST company on the planet.
"$BAC Seriously, a borderline evil company. I pray their stock reflects as much."
$BAC Plenty of companies deserve and will reward your hard won cash. Don&#39;t reward these thieves. Industry shills and MM. Screw them.
$BAC Long term investments in real products like $TSLA or $KNDI pay for real reasons.
$KNDI &quot;Watershed year for electric vehicles&quot;... http://stks.co/i0AKA
@howardlindzon Largest EV in China. Cheap. Partner w/ Greely (Volvo). Population. Pollution. Solution. Crazy non-news ride today. $TSLA?

&quot;@kozmicbluesman: $BAC @sogenerous @apwriter Try Keybanc ... $70 target on $SODA.. b4 it tanked -26%&quot; No barrier to entry. $70? HBS Grads.
&quot;@jevans2502: @coopervegas my cost basis on $BAC is just under $7/share.&quot; Time to make those profits work a little harder.
$BAC Today a lucrative one for me &amp; I have zero investment in BOA. Its a villainous company and someone needs to say so. I did. The End.
$KNDI Nascent. Understatement.
&quot;@smitherines: $KNDI if this goes green - watch the f out. could hit 20 with volume.&quot; Would LOVE to be that wrong.
$KNDI Under pressure. Gotta pop.
$KNDI Rides in $tsla wake.
$KNDI Expiring puts out if the game already. No more downward pressure.
$KNDI Man. Anyone feeling dÃ©jÃ  vu from yesterday. Wait till $tsla calms down.
$KNDI $tsla flying. $kndi follows it&#39;s lead. Same expiration pressure.
$KNDI Artifical low. Pinning by MM. News is felt after expiration. Late today or Mon it soars. Just bought moe Feb options.
$KNDI Mkt mkrs can only put the kid on reality for so long.
$KNDI Lid on. Oops.
$KNDI Quiet before the storm. Like clockwork.
&quot;@SmartMonkey: $KNDI Anyone should listen and finally think yourself&quot; Amen.
"$tsla: $KNDI Production of China&#39;s pure electric passenger vehicles reached 6,165 units 12/13 http://stks.co/psqt 1/3 of all CHINA&quot;"
$KNDI Black Friday. Christmas is coming Monday.
$KNDI Haven&#39;t been this excited I bought $aapl @$20. Old. I know.
$KNDI We are all too excited to get a real life.
$KNDI Feels like $aapl right before the IPod.
$KNDI BTW Greely has both $kndi and Volvo. solid play here.
$KNDI Today is expir Fri. Clearly not a retail move. MM oinning $14s. that&#39;s all this is. Buy.
$KNDI $tsla effect starting now.
$KNDI Who doesn&#39;t want to hold over weekend w news. Rally by close.
$KNDI $tsla moves.  Gets boring. We get attention. I&#39;m I the only one noticing this?
$KNDI So long 13s. Never B back again.
$KNDI 10 bucks next month. Easy.
$KNDI I get I&#39;m on here too much but it&#39;s rare to see a hole in the mkt this large. We don&#39;t yet grasp the enormity. U gasp for air there.
&quot;@hypertrader: $KNDI expecting a bounce on tuesday morning- 1-2 dollars jump in am be ready folks&quot; Hope it opens kissing 15.
$KNDI Nipping 14.
$KNDI News this weekend Killer Smog. EV needed there like face masks. Cops pulling gas cars off the street on bad days. EVs no restriction
&quot;@CatBus: $KNDI Off topic. I cant get thinkorswim to load today after my Java update.&quot; There&#39;s a quick fix. Mac?
$KNDI Pattern I see is $tsla grabs vol when moving then returns.
$KNDI Vol issue. EV $s in play @ $tsla. BRB.
$KNDI $tsla building China charging network for $kndi. Elon gets it.
$KNDI Mkt down but $tsla up. China pollution big news. Could move despite mkt.
$KNDI Price has memory. This is where it took off.
$KNDI Dow bouncing back.
$KNDI Party at $tsla. Our dates found a prettier girl.
$KNDI Would you short a triple bottom? I&#39;d buy.

$KNDI What could this sentiment indicator be measuring?
$KNDI P/c ratio falling further. Here we go!

"&quot;@SmartMonkey: $KNDI Friends, HIMX up &gt;9% today :)&quot; Was gonna in a.m. Another one got away."
&quot;@ffexts: $KNDI and $TSLA should work together!!&quot; Amen. The world gets cleaner.
$KNDI Follows $tsla. Both always rebound.
$KNDI No worries. Same graph at $tsla.
$KNDI Some times it&#39;s just common sense. Cheap EV in China by major player w gov  support and edict. June options keep me calm.
$KNDI Down all around. The only story.
$KNDI Man. Mirrors $tsla.
$KNDI Man. Mirrors $tsla.
$KNDI Same Vol as $tsla. Interest is building.
"&quot;@Robcass: $KNDI Anyone penning a seeking alpha article to show the valuation with 2 towers in 13, and the 20 in 14?&quot; You! I&#39;ll edit."
$KNDI Man. We just saw some serious market manipulation to get in cheap. Very Bullish sign. Someone sees something big.
$KNDI Msg clear: institutions figured it out. Shorting to buy big. Novices will play into their hand. Hold 4 the Big Bang they believe in.
$KNDI 1/1/15. What&#39;s your projection? Me first. $50.
$KNDI P/c ratio falling to insane .119. Institutions short to play options. Ratio falling w price says retail getting played. BIG rebound.
$KNDI Dow still dropping. $kndi holding.  Others getting creamed. Bullish.
$KNDI Dow moving up. Buy.
$KNDI Green. I forget the percentage but like 85 % chance green after 5 consecutive lower opens.
$KNDI Anyone still waiting for the gap to fill is also waiting for $tsla to hit $37.5 after it&#39;s first kick upstairs.
$KNDI The more this ticks up the more we bear from hitherto anon. Bears.
$KNDI Squeeze!
$KNDI Weird. $tsla vs $kndi mirror chart today. Must be Dow.
$KNDI MM trolls are as obvious as undercover agents in Crown Vic&#39;s.
&quot;@Trader444: $KNDI Huffington Post talks Kandi today: http://stks.co/d09cn&quot; Huge!
$KNDI 10.35 for gap. Huge rebound awaits. 100% fib= MAJOR rally.

$KNDI Will be worth the wait. Always is.
$KNDI Will be worth the wait. Always is.

$KNDI Vol spike on green = hammer on shorts coffin. Buckle up.
$KNDI huffpo. China war on pollution. New today. http://stks.co/c09ea
"&quot;@carlmul: $KNDI sales vs PPS at 5x which is where it is now, comes to $38 by EOY 14, and TSLA multiple for same is 50x, assumes 300% YY&quot;"
$KNDI Every year population the size of Dallas dies from pollution in China. Westerners won&#39;t visit. Yeah. What upside?
$KNDI Big institutions play options. That P/C ratio is the lighthouse.
&quot;@apwriter: $KNDI June options: 1115 calls vs 5 Puts. Crazy!&quot; That&#39;s 111500 shares long vs 500 shares short. Up.
$KNDI $tsla sucking $. Levels off then our turn. HATE opening gaps. get filled. I curse the guy/gal who created that idea.

$BBRY I think we all saw this coming on Friday when $BBRY closed near HOD and 40MM volume
$BBRY $BB.CA almost always trades the same price as $BBRY currency adjusted.So tomorrow $BB.CA will adjust to what ever $BBRY is trading at.
$BBRY I can envision $12.00 tomorrow with panic short covering

"If you see anything in $TWTR, $TSLA is more exciting, and has an actual profitable product."
"$AAPL besides the weekly call gamblers, how can you hate on this?  Great recovery from July, and on a 10 year unbroken uptrend!"
$FB cant tell much by this past week - volume very low compared to run up and culmination in 12/23.  My money is on $60 1/17 4:00pm.

$EBAY Really need a reason to break the downtrend here. Key battle point. The next day or two will tell us if we wedge down to 50 or not.
$AAPL China pre-orders should drive strong growth predictions.
nice chart &quot;@biogemfinder: $EXEL we really have to pierce through the wall of resistance at 6 so that its smooth sailing in 2014!&quot;
